A tiny little app for organising discussions. Work in progress.

---

A discussion takes place at a certain location, on a certain topic and while
drinking a certain beverage.

The discussion's state can change over time so it is modelled as a list of
updates. Each update refers to either the topic, the location or the beverage.
The discussion's current state is derived from the most recent updates.

For example, while a discussion might start on one topic, it can be updated as
it changes to another topic but we keep a list of previous topics.

The ActiveRecord models are Discussion, Update, Topic, Location and Beverage.
There's a polymorphic thingie in there which makes it all work. This is the
first time I have tried to use one of ActiveRecord's more advanced features.
Please send me any feedback you might have.
